# **Team Name:**

GradMap

# **Mission Statement:**

Helping students map their future.

# **Problem Description:**

This year, UBC switched systems from the SSC to Workday and with this change, the degree navigator was removed. Now, current UBC students have trouble organizing their courses and the future courses they wish to take. Specifically they are unsure on which courses they can take and if they want to take a course, what courses they must take as prerequisites to do said course.
