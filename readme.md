# **Team Name:**

GradMap

# **Mission Statement:**

Helping students map their future.

# **Problem Description:**

This year, UBC switched systems from the SSC to Workday and with this change, the degree navigator tool was removed. Now, UBC students are having trouble organizing their current and future courses that they wish to take. Specifically, students are unsure on which courses they can currently take and which prerequisites they would need for other courses. Students need a way to visualize a list of prerequisite courses to be able to plan multiple years ahead in their degree and without the degree navigator there isn't a great way to do this.
