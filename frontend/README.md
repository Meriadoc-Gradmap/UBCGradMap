# Frontend

This is the web frontend for gradmap.

It is written with TypeScript, Vite, and React.js.

# Installing
First figure out how to install npm on your platform.

Next, install all the dependancies:
```sh
npm install
```

# Running
To run the frontend, use
```sh
npm run dev
```
However, this only runs the html frontend, not the api. To also run the api, go to the main folder and run
```sh
./gradlew run
```
Then, navigate to http://localhost:5173. This should be a fully functional gradmap instance.
